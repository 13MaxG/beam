Even setting up the environment, installing the dependencies, and setting up the project can be an overwhelming amount of boilerplate.\n",

    "Here we provide a simple YAML syntax for describing pipelines that does not require coding experience or learning how to use an SDK&mdash;any text editor will do.\n",

    "Please note: YAML API is still EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we set up your development environment and write a simple pipeline using YAML. We'll run it locally, using the [DirectRunner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/). You can explore other runners with the [Beam Capatibility Matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).\n",
