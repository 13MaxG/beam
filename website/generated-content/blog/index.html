  <meta name="description" content="Apache Beam is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows, and also data ingestion and integration flows, supporting Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Dataflow pipelines simplify the mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on a number of runtimes like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow (a cloud service). Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration processes.

<p>Apache Beam’s primitives let you build expressive data pipelines, suitable for a
variety of use cases. One specific use case is the analysis of time series data
in which continuous sequences across window boundaries are important. A few fun
challenges arise as you tackle this type of data and in this blog we will
explore one of those in more detail and make use of the Timer API
(<a href="/blog/2017/08/28/timely-processing.html">blog post</a>)
using the “looping timer” pattern.</p>

<p>A new, exciting feature that came to Apache Beam is the ability to use
SQL in your pipelines. This is done using Beam’s
<a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/SqlTransform.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">SqlTransform</code></a>
in Java pipelines.</p>

<p>Beam also has a fancy new SQL command line that you can use to query your
data interactively, be it Batch or Streaming. If you haven’t tried it, check out
<a href="http://bit.ly/ExploreBeamSQL">http://bit.ly/ExploreBeamSQL</a>.</p>

<p>A nice feature of the SQL CLI is that you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE</code>
commands to <em>add</em> data sources to be accessed in the CLI. Currently, the CLI
supports creating tables from BigQuery, PubSub, Kafka, and text files. In this
post, we explore how to add new data sources, so that you will be able to
consume data from other Beam sources.</p>

<h1 id="the-apache-beam-community-in-2019">The Apache Beam community in 2019</h1>

<p>2019 has already been a busy time for the Apache Beam community. The ASF blog featured <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/date/20190222">our way of community building</a> and we’ve had <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam/events/257482350">more Beam meetups</a>  around the world. Apache Beam also received the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3336072/infoworlds-2019-technology-of-the-year-award-winners.html">Technology of the Year Award</a> from InfoWorld.</p>

<p>As these events happened, we were building up to the <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/03/celebrating-20-years-of-apache.html">20th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation</a>.  The contributions of the Beam community were a part of Maximilian Michels blog post on the success of the ASF’s open source development model:</p>

<p>In that spirit, let’s have an overview of the things that have happened, what the next few months look like, and how we can foster even more community growth.</p>

<h2 id="meetups">Meetups</h2>
<p>We’ve had a flurry of activity, with several meetups in the planning process and more popping up globally over time. As diversity of contributors is a core ASF value, this geographic spread is exciting for the community. Here’s a picture from the latest Apache Beam meetup organized at Lyft in San Francisco:</p>

<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/1/2/600_481292786.jpeg" alt="Beam Meetup Bay Area" /></p>

<p>We have more <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam">Bay Area meetups</a> coming soon, and the community is looking into kicking off a meetup in Toronto!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Apache-Beam-Meetup">London</a> had its first meetup of 2019 at the start of April:</p>

<h2 id="why-community-engagement-matters">Why community engagement matters</h2>
<p>Why we need a strong Apache Beam community:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We’re receiving lots of code contributions and need committers to review those and help onboard new contributors to the project.</li>
  <li>We want people to feel a sense of ownership to the project. By fostering this level of engagement, the work becomes even more exciting.</li>
  <li>A healthy community has a further reach and leads to more growth. More hours can be contributed to the project as we can spread the work and ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are we organizing these summits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We’d like to give folks a place to meet, congregate, and share ideas.</li>
  <li>We know that offline interactions often changes the nature of the online ones in a positive manner.</li>
  <li>Building an active and diverse community is part of the Apache Way. These summits provide an opportunity for us to engage people from different locations, companies, and backgrounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new website dedicated to Beam Summits!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://beamsummit.org">beamsummit.org</a> site provides all the information you need towards the upcoming Beam Summits in Europe, Asia and North America in 2019. You will find information about the conference theme, the speakers and sessions, the abstract submission timeline and the registration process, the conference venues and hosting cities - and much more that you will find useful until and during the Beam Summits 2019.</p>

<p>We are working to make the website easy to use, so that anyone who is organizing a Beam event can rely on it. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/matthiasa4/hoverboard">code for it in Github</a>.</p>

<p>The pages will be updated on a regular basis, but we also love hearing thoughts from our community! Let us know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions, and help us improve! Also, if you are thinking of organizing a Beam event, please feel free to reach out for support, and to use the code in GitHub as well.</p>

<p>We sincerely hope that you like the new Beam Summit website and will find it useful for accessing information. Enjoy browsing around!</p>

<p>See you in Berlin!</p>

<p>On January 10, 2017, Apache Beam got <a href="/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html">promoted</a>
as a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project. It was an important milestone
that validated the value of the project, legitimacy of its community, and
heralded its growing adoption. In the past year, Apache Beam has been on a
phenomenal growth trajectory, with significant growth in its community and
feature set. Let us walk you through some of the notable achievements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="/blog/2017/02/13/stateful-processing.html">prior blog
post</a>, I
introduced the basics of stateful processing in Apache Beam, focusing on the
addition of state to per-element processing. So-called <em>timely</em> processing
complements stateful processing in Beam by letting you set timers to request a
(stateful) callback at some point in the future.</p>

<p>What can you do with timers in Beam? Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can output data buffered in state after some amount of processing time.</li>
  <li>You can take special action when the watermark estimates that you have
received all data up to a specified point in event time.</li>
  <li>You can author workflows with timeouts that alter state and emit output in
response to the absence of additional input for some period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few possibilities. State and timers together form a powerful
programming paradigm for fine-grained control to express a huge variety of
workflows.  Stateful and timely processing in Beam is portable across data
processing engines and integrated with Beam’s unified model of event time
windowing in both streaming and batch processing.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the Apache Beam ecosystem is its quickly
growing set of connectors that allow Beam pipelines to read and write data to
various data storage systems (“IOs”). Currently, Beam ships <a href="/documentation/io/built-in/">over 20 IO
connectors</a> with many more in
active development. As user demands for IO connectors grew, our work on
improving the related Beam APIs (in particular, the Source API) produced an
unexpected result: a generalization of Beam’s most basic primitive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoFn</code>.</p>

<p>Beam lets you process unbounded, out-of-order, global-scale data with portable
high-level pipelines. Stateful processing is a new feature of the Beam model
that expands the capabilities of Beam, unlocking new use cases and new
efficiencies. In this post, I will guide you through stateful processing in
Beam: how it works, how it fits in with the other features of the Beam model,
what you might use it for, and what it looks like in code.</p>

<p><strong>Note: This post has been updated in May of 2019, to include Python
snippets!</strong></p>

<p>One year ago today Apache Beam was accepted into incubation at the Apache
Software Foundation. The community’s work over the past year culminated, just
over three weeks ago, with an <a href="/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html">announcement</a>
that Apache Beam has successfully graduated as a new Top-Level Project at the
foundation. Graduation sparked an additional interest in the project, from
corporate endorsements, news articles, interviews, to the volume of traffic to
our website and mailing lists.</p>

<p>The Beam Programming Model unifies writing pipelines for Batch and Streaming
pipelines. We’ve recently introduced a new PTransform to write tests for
pipelines that will be run over unbounded datasets and must handle out-of-order

included the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK">Dataflow Java SDK</a>. In the long term, however, Apache Beam aims to support SDKs implemented in multiple languages, such as Python.</p>

<p>One of the major benefits of Apache Beam is the fact that it unifies both
both batch and stream processing into one powerful model. In fact, this unification

<p>When the project started, we wanted a logo which was both appealing and visually
represented this unification.</p>
