&lt;/header>
&lt;p>eBay is an American e-commerce company that provides business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer sales through the online website. They build feature pipelines with Apache Beam: unify feature extraction and selection in online and offline, speed up E2E iteration for model training, evaluation and serving, support different types (streaming, runtime, batch) of features, etc. eBay leverages Apache Beam for the streaming feature SDK as a foundation to integrate with Kafka, Hadoop, Flink, Airflow and others in eBay.&lt;/p>
